The repository is a small collection of Pandas projects that deal with data cleaning and exploaration techniques, regression, and classification.


DataCleaningProject
The project was done to practice data cleaning techniques. The scope of the project was to gather data from various files to prepare it for potential supervised learning modeling to predict cancellations. The source files contain the past three months of customer data, which includes subscription and listening history from a streaming platform.


RegressionProject
The goal of the project was to create a Linear Regression model that predicts the "price" column in the dataset on San Francisco apartment rentals. The target mean absolute error was <= 500 dollars. 
The second part of the project deals with a time-series problem in the form of an electricity usage scenario.


ClassificationProject
The project tackles fitting and tuning a Logistic Regression model on data to predict if a given individual is likely to earn more than 50,000. The second part also contains an example of a multi-class problem in the form of credit scores prediction. In the last part, the classification of individuals is done via ensemble models: combining LR, KN and decision tree models, fitting Random Forest model, and fitting Gradient Boosting model.


Hope you'll enjoy reading the code.
